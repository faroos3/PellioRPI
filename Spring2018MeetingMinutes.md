Minhas and  I, Logan, worked on updating the python Django from 1.9 to 2 in most of the files. 
built the website, noticed that there were no images, so thats an issue to work on.
K and I are still working on installing pip or Mysql correctly. We are futzing around with building the website on Minhas' machine.

Logan is working on his environment on his laptop, and we decided to 'refactor' the file system of Pellio as right now it is very confusing and unintuitive. We will be working more on the refactoring tomorrow at small group meeting
