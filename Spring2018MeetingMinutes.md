Minhas and  I, Logan, worked on updating the python Django from 1.9 to 2 in most of the files. 
built the website, noticed that there were no images, so thats an issue to work on.
K and I are still working on installing pip or Mysql correctly. We are futzing around with building the website on Minhas' machine.
